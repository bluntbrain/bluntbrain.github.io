                                    that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not

                                    extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
                                    to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
                                    versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,

                                    StreamShiksha is committed to ensuring that the app is
                                    as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
                                    reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
                                    its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
                                    charge you for the app or its services without making it very
                                    clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    The StreamShiksha app stores and processes personal data at your device only.
                            We do not collect your personal information or personal files.
                            It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
                                    access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do
                                    not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                                    removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
                                    official operating system of your device. It could make your
                                    phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
                                    compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
                                    that the StreamShiksha app won’t work properly or at all.

                                    You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                    StreamShiksha will not take responsibility for. Certain
                                    functions of the app will require the app to have an active
                                    internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
                                    by your mobile network provider, but StreamShiksha
                                    cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
                                    functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                                    have any of your data allowance left.
                                  </p> <p></p> <p>
                                    If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                    should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                                    mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
                                    be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
                                    the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                                    other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
                                    responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                                    charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
                                    (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
                                    you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                                    using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
                                    received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    Along the same lines, StreamShiksha cannot always take
                                    responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
                                    make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
                                    battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
                                    StreamShiksha cannot accept responsibility.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    With respect to StreamShiksha’s responsibility for your
                                    use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
                                    bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
                                    updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
                                    to provide information to us so that we can make it available
                                    to you. StreamShiksha accepts no liability for any
                                    loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
                                    relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                                  </p> <p>
                                    At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
                                    currently available on Android – the requirements for
                                    system(and for any additional systems we
                                    decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
                                    and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                    using the app. StreamShiksha does not promise that it
                                    will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
                                    and/or works with the Android version that you have
                                    installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                                    accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                                    also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
                                    it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
                                    Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
                                    rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
                                    (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
                                    from your device.
